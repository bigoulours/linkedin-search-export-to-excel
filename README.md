This tool allows to search people on LinkedIn with a user's own credentials.\
It is based on [linkedin-api](https://github.com/bigoulours/linkedin-api) which uses the LinkedIn Voyager API.\
Search can be done using a specific company public ID (www[]().linkedin.com/company/\<public-id\>), thus narrowing search results.\
Company public IDs and Bing geo urn IDs can be added in the dedicated text files.
